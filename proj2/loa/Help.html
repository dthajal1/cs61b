<p> 
  Lines of Action (LOA) is a board game invented by Claude Soucie.

<h2>Rules</h2>
Rules:
You can move one checker in one direction at a time, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The total number of checkers (including your opponents) in that column (aka file), row (aka rank), or diagonal path determines how many spaces that checker must move, if moved. Your checkers can jump over your own checkers, but cannot land on your checkers. Your checkers can land on your opponent’s checkers, but cannot jump over your opponent’s checkers. Landing on your opponent’s checker, removes that checker from the game. Black moves first. The winner is the first player to connect all of their checkers still on the board. In the event that one move results in a connection for both players, the game traditionally results in a draw. Additionally, when a player has only one remaining checker on the board, that player wins, as one checker is considered a continuous line.
