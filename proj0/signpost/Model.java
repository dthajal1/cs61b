/** The state of a Signpost puzzle.  Each cell has coordinates (x, y),
 *  where 0 <= x < width(), 0 <= y < height().  The upper-left corner
 *  of the puzzle has coordinates (0, height() - 1), and the lower-right
 *  corner is at (width() - 1, 0).
 *
 *  A constructor initializes the squares according to a particular
 *  solution.  A solution is an assignment of sequence numbers from 1
 *  to size() == width() * height() to square positions so that
 *  squares with adjacent numbers are separated by queen moves. A
 *  queen move is a move from one square to another horizontally,
 *  vertically, or diagonally. The effect is to give each square whose
 *  number in the solution is less than size() an <i>arrow
 *  direction</i>, 1 <= d <= 8, indicating the direction of the next
 *  higher numbered square in the solution: d * 45 degrees clockwise
 *  from straight up (i.e., toward higher y coordinates).  Thus,
 *  direction 1 is "northeast", 2 is "east", ..., and 8 is "north".
 *  The highest-numbered square has direction 0.  Certain squares can
 *  have their values <i>fixed</i> to those in the solution.
 *  Initially, the only two squares with fixed values are those with
 *  the lowest and highest sequence numbers in the solution.  Before
 *  the puzzle is presented to the user, however, the program fixes
 *  other numbers so as to make the solution unique for the given
 *  arrows.
 *
 *  At any given time after initialization, a square whose value is
 *  not fixed may have an unknown value, represented as 0, or a
 *  tentative number (not necessarily that of the solution) between 1
 *  and size(). Squares may be connected together, indicating that
 *  their sequence numbers (unknown or not) are consecutive.
 *
 *  When square S0 is connected to S1, we say that S1 is the
 *  <i>successor</i> of S0, and S0 is the <i>predecessor</i> of S1.
 *  Sequences of connected squares with as-yet unknown values (denoted
 *  by 0) form a <i>group</i>, identified by a unique <i>group
 *  number</i>.  Numbered cells (whether linked or not) are in group
 *  0.  Unnumbered, unlinked cells are in group -1.  On the board displayed
 *  to the user, cells in the same group indicate their grouping and sequence
 *  with labels such as "a", "a+1", "a+2", etc., with a different letter
 *  for each different group.  The first square in a group is called the
 *  <i>head</i> of the group.  Each unnumbered square points to the head
 *  of its group (if the square is unlinked, it points to itself).
 *
 *  Squares are represented as objects of the inner class Sq
 *  (Model.Sq).  A Model object is itself iterable. That is, if M is
 *  of type Model, one can write
 *       for (Model.Sq s : M) { ... }
 *  to sequence through all its squares in unspecified order.
 *
 *  The puzzle is solved when all cells are contained in a single
 *  sequence of consecutively numbered cells (therefore all in group
 *  0) and all cells with fixed sequence numbers appear at the
 *  corresponding position in that sequence.
